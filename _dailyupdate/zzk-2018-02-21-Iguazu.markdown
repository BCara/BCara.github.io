3 days, 3 countries. 

The past few days have been pretty busy but also amazing. Obviously, before leaving Brazil and heading to Argentina we had to stop at Iguazu falls and this makes perfect sense as it is possible to see Iguazu falls from both Brazil and Argentina so it made a perfect crossing point. 
We arrived from Rio into Foz de Iguazu stupidly early (5AM). Joe was able to take a nap on the floor of the airport but I struggled with this so just had to power on through. Our first hurdle was to get a bus into Foz de Iguazu so we could drop our bags and then head to the falls. We had done the research and knew that we needed to get the 120 bus, however, 3 buses went passed and didn't let us on, not being able to speak any Portugese I had no idea why but we eventually made it. We later found out that the airport was the middle stop, therefore the buses that didn't let us on were actually stopping at the falls before heading into town.

## Iguazu Falls - Brazil

The same day we arrived we dropped our stuff off and got back on the same bus (120) that we had used to get from the airport and headed straight to the falls. Once at the entrance we waited in line for a bus that took us to a trek that lead to the main falls. As soon as we got off the bus we noticed a few Racoon type creatures which were really quite cute. However, according to the signs they can be quite viscious. We carried on down the 1.5km trek which followed the river. It was a beatiful walk but unfortunately there were a lot of people and because of this it wasn't as sarene as it could have been. We went about midday so maybe a better time to go would have been in the morning. 

Once you get to the end of the trek there's a bridge that takes you into the middle of the river where you get a fantastic view of the falls from the bottom along with a lot of water spray. It's magnificient seeing how big the falls are when you are stood right in the middle. 

It was at this point I started getting texts about internet usuage. I am on a three contract and am able to use my inclusive minutes in Brazil but not in Argentina. Now I was still in Brazil but stood extremely close to the border so my phone must have picked up an argentinian signal and started charging me. Ahhh by the end of thr trip i had Â£24 internet service charges. What a way to make a beautiful stunning experience turn sour. Fortunately, I rang three and they reimbursed me completely!! 

All in all it was an amazing day with the Brazil side of the falls being truly stunning!

## Itaipu Dam - Paraguay

The following day we decided to nip into Paraguay and visit the Itaipu Dam. It is possible to do this trip from Brazil but after doing some research it looked as though the cheapest option was Paraguay as their tour around the dam is free. 
We started our journey into Paraguay and Joe started to panic as we passed the border. If you are on a public bus they don't stop at the border so you just go along through. However, this appeared to be the norm. 

We ended up getting off the bus at the last stop and
