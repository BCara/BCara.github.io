So our Journey takes us to Dubai for a quick stopover before we head to Cape Town to begin the journey through Southern Africa. 
Entering Dubai, obviously the first thing you notice is the blistering heat. I knew it was hot (31 to 35 degrees) but didn't realise how uncomfortable that actually was. Luckily for me I brought some very light hareem pants which were my lifesaver for the whole stopover in Dubai. 
As we travelled from the airport to the hotel the buildings all look extremely impressive, one after the other towering higher and higher each trying to compete with the last. Although the buildings stand tall there's a layer of fog that covers the landscape which I can only assume is from the sandy desert.

So we had three days to check out Dubai

<b>Day 1 - Emirates Mall and the Gold Souk</b>

The Gold Souk was an experience. Shops laid out with beautiful gold chest pieces which were absolutely stunning and completely unaffordable but I can dream. I have to admit that it was slightly off putting having sooo many people being a little too pushy in selling their goods.

<b>Day 2 - Wild Wadi Waterpark</b>

As it says in the title this was a visit to a waterpark and it was worth the trip. It was perfect for a hot day in Dubai with some cool slides, one of which where you start stood up in a futuristic star trek pod and then drop. The best attraction was the surfing I managed to get up onto my knees for about a second but I still say that counts.                                                                                        

<b>Day 3 - Desert Safari and BBQ</b>

This was the highlight for the Dubai part of the travels. Got to try out sandboarding, Henna, Shisha and a fantastic BBQ dinner. I also had a ride on a Camel which will probably be my last as the poor guy didn't seem to enjoy it. The best part was the dune bashing where we sat in a 4x4 with a roll cage and just slammed into the dunes. 

Next stop Cape Town...
