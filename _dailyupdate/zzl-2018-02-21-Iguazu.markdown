3 days, 3 countries. 

The past few days have been pretty busy but also amazing. Obviously, before leaving Brazil and heading to Argentina we had to stop at Iguazu falls and this makes perfect sense as it is possible to see Iguazu falls from both Brazil and Argentina so it made a perfect crossing point. 
We arrived from Rio into Foz de Iguazu stupidly early (5AM). Joe was able to take a nap on the floor of the airport but I struggled with this so just had to power on through. Our first hurdle was to get a bus into Foz de Iguazu so we could drop our bags and then head to the falls. We had done the research and knew that we needed to get the 120 bus, however, 3 buses went passed and didn't let us on, not being able to speak any Portugese I had no idea why but we eventually made it. We later found out that the airport was the middle stop, therefore those buses were actually stopping at the falls before heading into town.
