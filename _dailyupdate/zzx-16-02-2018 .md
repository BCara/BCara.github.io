Today was a busy day. Early in the morning we went to see Christ the Redeemer, unfortunately, it was quite cloudy but after waiting some time we got some clear views. In the afternoon we walked Urca and then got the cable car the rest of the way to sugarloaf mountain. The views were tremendous and although it was cloudy with a broken sunset we also managed to see a thunderstorm.
