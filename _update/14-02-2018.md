It threatened thunder storms in Rio today so instead of Christ the Redeemer we decided to walk around the city and take in the sites. We walked 21km along Rios walking path and visited Cocacabana and Ipanema Beaches and also had a beautiful view of Christ the Redeemer across the beautiful Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon.
