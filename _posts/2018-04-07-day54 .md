We spent the morning queuing for ALMA! ALMA is an observatory that carries out astronomy research and they have public visits every weekend but they are full so far in advance. So we decided to turn up and hope that because it was free to sign up people may not turn up but unfortunately they did. In the afternoon there was another BIG game of football (apparently) and that didn't go very well either. So today was a VERY disappointing day for both myself and Joe. We did go stargazing in the evening and saw Jupiter and three of its many moons which was pretty cool.
