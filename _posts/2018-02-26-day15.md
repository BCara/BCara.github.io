We took a ferry from Buenos Aires over to Colonia Del Sacremento in Uruguay where spent the day. Colonia is a quaint little city with cobble stones lining the streets, it was definitely worth the visit. We had a great view of the city from the top of the lighthouse and you can just make out Buenos Aires along with visiting Porton de Campo which are remnants of the old city walls.
