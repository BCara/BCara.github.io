Up at 6:30 AM to go to Magdalena island to visit the penguin colony. So many penguins were roaming about the tiny island. The babies had already been born and left the island but their parents were still there. We also visted another island where we saw sea lions who were fighting each other. After the tour we visited the cemetery in Punta Arenas and as with the cemetery in Buenos Aires we saw some grand mausoleums.
