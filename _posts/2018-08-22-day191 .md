We never actually stayed in Seattle but we a couple of nights near the city. The traffic getting around Seattle was horrendous, it's not something I would want to do regularly. 

On our journey to Seattle we stopped at a hydroelectric dam in Snoqualamie. We have seen quite a few dams on our trip but I still find them fascinating. In the evening we then headed to a Rodeo, it had an amazing atmosphere. There were so may families there enjoying themselves and just simply having a good time. The event was part of a fair which is only on once a year so it appears to be the 'thing' to do around the town. The rodeo itself wasn't really for me, I didn't like the way people were being judged for upsetting the bull and getting kicked off.
