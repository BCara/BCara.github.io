Today we started a nice relaxing walk to the waterfalls in Montezuma, or so we thought. The walk ended up being quite treacherous with seriously steep, slippy and soggy paths. 10 minutes in and we were traipsing through the river to get to the other side. 

The walk to the first waterfall wasn't too bad but then we headed to the upper waterfall which was seriously steep going up and then back down. There were guide ropes to hold on to and we had to struggle to find places to put our feet without slipping. 

Eventually we made it and it was kind of worth it. It was an interesting walk but it wasn't the most exciting waterfall.
