Nothing exciting today. We had some major issues with flights being cancelled not getting our credits and problems rebooking, blah blah blah. We did get a ferry over to Isla Mujeres but that's about as much excitement as we got today. However, we did get a tour booked for tomorrow so hopefully it will be a better day.
