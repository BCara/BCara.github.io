As it was meant to be raining we planned for a chilled day spending more time around the town and planning the next few days. Bariloche is known for it's chocolate so we went in a couple of chocolate shops and bought some for taste tests. We bought specific Rama chocolate in both white and milk chocolate expecting it to be similar to a flake but it really wasn't.
