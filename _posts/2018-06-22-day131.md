The morning was spent on a walking tour around Guatape where we learned a lot about the town. It was interesting to hear about the zocalos which are drawings located on the base of each of the buildings. They are there to represent the interests, careers and stories of the house owner. 

In the afternoon we climbed a big rock! Yes, one big rock - nothing special about it apart from it is huge. The Penol Rock is what Guatape is famous for. At the top we had absolutely stunning views of the town and and the lake.
