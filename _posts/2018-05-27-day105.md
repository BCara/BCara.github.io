We made our way to El Nuro to swim with the turtles. El Nuro is a very small town near to Los Organos which is near Mancora. The huge turtles are attracted there because the fisherman bring back there fish to this pier in the mornings. There are so many turtles and its pretty cool watching them from the pier, I never expected them to be so huge. We got in the water with the turtles which was pretty amazing.
