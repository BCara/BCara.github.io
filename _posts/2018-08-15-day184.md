The Grand Canyon, Bloody huge!! We headed straight to the visitor centre and stopped at Mather point view site and it was, of course, spectacular. We then started to take the Bright Angel Trail which heads down and into the canyon, we didn't head down all the way because of time. We turned around and then drove down desert drive, stopping at the view points along the way. There are really no words to describe the canyon, It has to be seen!

Our next stop was at horseshoe bend. We got out of the car and followed the line of tourists up a dirt road. There was a sign suggesting we needed water, hat and a good pair of shoes, however, as far as we were concerned we were just heading to a view point. Well, it was just a viewpoint and it wasn't too far but in the heat it was knackering but it was worth it. You can see the canyon with the sparkling blue river curving round to make the horse shoe shape. Beautiful.
