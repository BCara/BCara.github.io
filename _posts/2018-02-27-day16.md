It was goodbye to Buenos Aires and hello to Ushuaia today. We got off the aeroplane and the drop in temperature was instantly noticeable. We didn't do much today but we got the chance to wander round the city as we made a plan for the following days. Ushuaia is beautiful! As you stand in the middle of the town you have a scenic view as you are surrounded by mountains that are covered in a layer of a mist.
