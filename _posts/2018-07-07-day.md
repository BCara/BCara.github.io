The morning was spent, well you guessed it, watching the England game and the afternoon was spent walking around the Observatory lodge. The weather wasn't too great so we didn't get a good view of Volcano Arenal which is meant to be the highlight here. Also, the walk itself didn't live up to much but we did see a beautiful frog which has to be the highlight of the day. 

...

Oh and obviously England making the semi finals.
