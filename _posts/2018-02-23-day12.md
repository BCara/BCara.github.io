Our second day out of six in Buenos Aires and we had no specific plan. On our walking tour from the previous day we learned about a cafe called Cafe Tortoni which opened in 1858 and still contained the original decor. We visited the cafe and it was like wlaking into the past, the room had beautiful stained glass windows and chandeliers. We then went to Plaza Dorrego which is the second oldest Plaza in Buenos Aires, behind the main Plaze de Mayo. Here we relaxed and had some wine whilst watching some Tango.
