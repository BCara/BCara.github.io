One of my best friends from Uni moved to Portland with her job and after not seeing her for literally ages I got to see Frankie today!! It felt so surreal just hanging out in the US, so far away from home but so normal as well. We did a short hike up Beacon Rock in Washington which was quite a steep climb zigzagging our way to the top. The views were beautiful looking over a large river and smaller streams surrounded by greenery. Unfortunately, there was a bit of smog in the air from general mist and forest fires but it was still an epic view.
