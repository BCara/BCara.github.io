We hung around Huacachina during the day as it's a beautiful Oasis and then head to Lima in the evening. We had already heard that Lima isn't the place to hang around so we only planned to stay there for a day and do the walking tour and I am glad we hadn't planned to stay much longer. Lima's fairly big so we may have missed out on a few things but I'm not that fussed. We did the walking tour which was interesting and worth doing then got on a night bus to Trujillo.
