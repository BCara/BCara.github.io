17 hours later and we arrived in the middle of the desert in San Pedro. The city was the complete opposite to San Pedro with lower buildings made from clay lining the streets. We did a short hike to some ruins but it was definitely more difficult then previously longer hikes due to the heat and the altitude. The altitude had severly changed and we are now up at 2500 metres, however, our onward travel is going to take us much higher.
