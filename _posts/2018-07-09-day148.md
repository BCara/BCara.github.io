A big travel day, from San Jose, Costa Rica to Santa Ana, El Salvador. When we set off for El Salvador our intention was to stay in the city San Salvador and do a walking tour. However, plans change and on our way to the airport we met some Germans who recommended Santa Ana and the volcano hike. A flight, 3 buses and a walk later that's where we ended up.
