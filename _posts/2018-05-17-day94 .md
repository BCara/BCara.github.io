This morning we woke up for a casual 3 hour 1000m uphill strole before breakfast. Have to say I am not going to rush into anything like that again any time soon. The previous day we hiked into Colca Canyon which was slightly easier but still difficult. It was worth it as the views were stunning, although the best part of the canyon was not from the hike but when we stopped over the top to view it from the car. Then after all the hard work hiking over the past few days we decided to punish ourselves and get an overnight bus. Not our best decision after hiking and a couple of 4am starts.
