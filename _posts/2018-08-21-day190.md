On our way to Washington we stopped at a beautiful spot at Couer d'Alene and did a small hike through the forest and had a quick dip in the lake. When we made it to Spokane we stopped at another lake for some fishing. It seemed to be the prime spot on the lake as we met quite a few people doing the same thing.
