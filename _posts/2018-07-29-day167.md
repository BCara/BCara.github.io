There haven't been any updates for awhile and that's because we have been relaxing in Utila. Well, not just relaxing! We have been diving!! For the last 10 days we managed to complete our PADI open water course. We didn't want to stop diving so we also did our advanced course which was super cool as we got to do some more interesting dives including a wreck and night dives. 

Utila is great it's a really small island with basically one road but with loads going on. Whilst we were there it was Carnival which is a big party with a parade and was lots of fun. 

This has been one of my top highlights of our trip and I don't want to stop diving but we leave tomorrow.
