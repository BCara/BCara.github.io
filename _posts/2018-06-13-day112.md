It's been a while since our last daily post but we have had limited internet and laziness on our side. After Mancora (Peru) we headed to Montanita (Ecuador) to enjoy another beach town but this time with dreary weather. Moving swiftly on to Guayaquil which we then moved even more swiftly on... Guayaquil wasn't too bad but not a place worth lingering around, in my opinion. 

Our next destination was the Galapagos and there are literally no words to describe it and it definitely warrants its own blog post. We decided to do it properly and do an 8 day cruise around the west side of the islands and although it was expensive it was well worth it. It was crazy watching how easy the flightless cormarants could dive under water, how penguins can always look so cute and how you can't stop looking at the weird but cool blue footed boobies. What an experience! This doesn't even cover the fact we watched an orca eat a sea turtle...

After having a fantastic time in the Galapagos we headed back up to altitude to Quito and spent today failing at trying to balance an egg on the equator line. It is possible, everyone else could do it.
