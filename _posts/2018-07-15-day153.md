It was the football World Cup final today so we obviously had to sit and watch that. After the game we headed to the edge of the lake where the water was clear and had a little swim and did some rock jumping. The water was surprisingly warm and much cleaner than I had expected. 

In the afternoon we went to check out Panajachel which is on the other side of the lake. I don't think we should have bothered really, I defintely preferred San Pedro. Finally we headed back to Antigua in anticipation of a long travel day tomorrow.
