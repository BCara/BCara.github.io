Two days at Etosha National Park was definitely an experience. Three of the big five; Lions, Elephants and the Black Rhino and that was in the first day. We rocked up to the park after a 6:30 early start and queued to get through the gate. Once we were through the animals were plentiful, Springbok, Zebra, Oryx... Each had their own fascinating characteristics. However, several Springbok later and they weren't quite so exciting and it was time to find some of the big five.

Etosha only has 4 of the big five as there are no Buffalo but they should pop up later on our trip. Unfortunately we didn't get to see any leopards due to timing, they are easier to spot early mornings or late evenings as otherwise they are hiding from the sun in the trees.

The first of the big five was a Lioness and it was sitting right on the edge of the road until we turned up and she sauntered back to a cub and another lioness who were relaxing in the sun. After a few minutes they separated and sat waiting for their prey. A group of Springbok got closer and closer to the prepared Lions but the cub, who was some distance from the springbok, sat up which gave away the Lions smell and the Springbok retreated.

My favourite moment from the park was watching the Elephants at the watering hole. There were four Elephants along with Springbok, Kudu, Zebra and many more who were drinking and cooling by the watering hall. There were two elephants who were fighting, heads against heads trying to get there tusks between the others. One was younger than the other and kept stopping to playfully submerge himself in the water. Once they were done playing 3 Elephants departed in one direction and the younger one went in the other direction. As elephants grow up they want to fight so they join other groups to practice this.

The final sighting of one of the big five was the Black Rhino and we were extremely fortunate as we were leaving the park. We managed to catch a glimpse of something rustling in the trees and lo and behold it was the Rhino.
