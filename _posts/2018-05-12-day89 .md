Today was extremely difficult but extremely rewarding! For the last 4 days and 3 nights we were on a Jungle Trek that ends at Machu Picchu. The trek included hiking, mountain biking, zip lining and water rafting so it was an adrenaline filled few days. Unfortunately, I wasn't very well on the third day of the trek and am still recovering today which meant that the 75 minute ascent up steps to Machu Picchu was a challenge. However, we made it in the end and it was 100% worth it! The views were incredible and although I would not recommend our guide it was still interesting to learn some of the Inca history.
