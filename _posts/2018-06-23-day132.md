Back in Medellin and Colombia played Poland in the world cup. We headed to a Plaza where it was completely filled with lively people. Colombia beat Poland and the whole place was ecstatic it was such an amazing atmosphere. 

In the evening we hopped onto an overnight bus to Santa Marta and with all the excitement we quickly fell asleep.
