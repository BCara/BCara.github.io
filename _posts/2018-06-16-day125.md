After a late evening we also had a late morning and the first thing we did was go for some food. That's when we discovered juices but with milk rather than water. On this trip I have realised how much I like passion fruit but passion fruit milkshake juice type thing is AMAZING. We had a little wander around the town which was really busy but it was a Saturday and then in the afternoon we headed to Cristo Rey which is a smaller version of Rios Christ the Redeemer.
