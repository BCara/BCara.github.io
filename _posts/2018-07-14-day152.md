Yesterday we set off on our adventure to Acatenango Volcano and spent the day hiking. It was a difficult uphill hike but it was nothing dissimilar to anything previous we had done. There was also a lot of stopping points which made it easier. The sceneray was OK, we didn't get many chances to see the view because there always seemed to be clouds but when they split it was amazing. 

We made it to base camp and it was at altitude so it was freezing cold. At camp you can see volcano Fuego which made the trip, unfortunately, we didn't get to see any lava or eruptions but it was an amazing view. It ended up being a long day made even longer by the inability to sleep because of the wind bashing on the tents. 

The next day of the trip was for us to hike to the top of the Acatenango volcano and see its crater, the sun rise and Fuego. It didn't take too long but it was extrememly windy and it wasn't the easiest path. Anyway, we made it to the top and it was beautiful it was a just a shame it was soo windy. On the way down my finger tips were in so much pain and I could barely move my hands from the cold. I didn't enjoy that part. 

Eventually we made it down and even after the exhausting 2 days hiking we hopped onto a shuttle to lake atitlan to relax for the evening.
