The Cloud Forest is one of the main highlights in Monteverde so we started the day early and went there for a relaxing walk. The hike took about 3 hours and it was interesting because it was different to some of our previous walks. There wasn't much in the way of views because of the clouds but it was these floating through the forest that made it mystical. 

The afternoon was spent travelling to La Fortuna ready for a hike around the Volcano Arenal.
