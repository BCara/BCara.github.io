Colombia played Poland in the world cup today. We headed to a Plaza where it was filled with lively people. Colombia beat Poland and the whole place was ecstatic, the atmosphere was amazing. 

In the evening we hopped onto an overnight bus to Santa Marta and with all the excitement we quickly fell asleep.
