We arrived in Santa Marta in the evening so just went out quickly for some food. The centre of Santa Marta was quite cool. There is one main street which is quite touristy but lively, we had one of the best ice creams ever from this main street. There were street dancers performing in the square, there was quite a european atmosphere.
