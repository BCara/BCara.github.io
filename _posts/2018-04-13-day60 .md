We just had one night stay in Uyuni as there isn't much to do and then took a 4 hour bus to Potosi. After arriving in Potosi we noticed there was some sort of parade which appeared to be because it was a holiday 'The day for the children'. We just had a quick look around the city of Potosi whilst we found somewhere to eat.
