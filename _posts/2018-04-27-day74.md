There haven't been any updates for awhile because we have spent the last two weeks static in Sucre not really doing much. The thing to do in Sucre is to learn Spanish and that's exactly what we have been attempting to do. Tonight we take the bus to La Paz, Bolivia and we can test out our Spanish there.
