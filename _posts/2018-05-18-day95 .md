After arriving to Nasca from Arequipa we made a quick stop over to the viewpoint where you can see three of the Nasca lines. The lines are believed to be made by the Nasca people and are drawings of different images that have been etched into the ground. From there we took a bus to Ica and then on to Huacachina which is a beautiful oasis 10 minutes drive away from Ica and on the edge of the sand dunes. We got here pretty late in the day but had been told that this was the best place to do sand boarding so that's just what we did. We set off on the dune buggies where there were times when it felt like a rollercoaster, bouncing up and out of the seats. The next part was sandboarding, we started pretty small but the last dune was crazy.
