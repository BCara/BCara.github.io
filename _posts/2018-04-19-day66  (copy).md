There haven't been any recent daily updates purely because we have been in Sucre for a few days and not done much in the way activities as we have been attempting Spanish lessons. We aren't doing too bad but we are a long way off being fluent. We have another week and a half of lessons so you never know we might get to be pros yet. Although, I am not so sure we went to buy fruit from the market today and ended up with way more strawberries than anticipated.
