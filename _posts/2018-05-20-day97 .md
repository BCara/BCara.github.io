Now in Trujillo we planned to see some archaelogical sites from the precolombian times. Unfortunately, we didn't get a guide and the book was only available in Spanish. We were with someone who spoke a fair amount of spanish so with her help and google we worked our way through the ruins of the city Chan Chan constructed by the Chimu people. Our next stop was the Sun and Moon archaelogical site but only checked it's closing time quite late and ended up not going. Then we hopped on our second night bus in a row to head to Mancora.
