Not knowing what to do in Pucon we decided to do a free walking tour to get to know the place which was definitely useful. In the afternoon we did an adrenaline activity, something called Hydrospeed which is like rafting but instead of on a boat you are in the water and on a float. It was crazy smashing into the rapids and trying to avoid rocks.
