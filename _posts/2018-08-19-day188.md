Day 2 in Yellowstone and today we started with a hike through Lamar Valley in the hope to find wolves and maybe bears (at a distance of course). The valley was beautiful and there was a huge heard of Buffalos with a few scattered around our trail, slightly too close for comfort. We continued on and heard what sounded like a pack of wolves, we may be in luck. We decided to change trails and head in the direction we heard the wolves but this turned out to be a mistake. We ended up having to cross a river with no easy route across so we waded knee deep to get to the other side. After all that we didn't end up seeing any wolves and turned back. 

At Norris we went to see some more Geysers including one that can erupt to about 120 metres but unfortunately it is difficult to predict and you could be standing there for years to see that. It was interesting walking around the different pools seeing the spectacular colour combinations. Our last stop of the day was some natural hotsprings you could swim in. These were made from a boiling river meeting a normal river to create a relaxing warm pool... most of the time it ended up being too hot or too cold. 

That's it for Yellowstone, there was still so much more that could have been done. Even the drive around the park was unbelievable beautiful.
