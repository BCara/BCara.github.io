It took 18 hours of travelling to get from Utila, Honduras to Flores, Guatemala. Needless to say we arrived very tired. The original plan was not to go straight to Flores but stay one night in Rio Dulce, however, we had already been there and didn't want to waste time. 

Unfortunately, our bus from Rio Dulce broke down and we had to wait for the next one where we had to stand for 2 hours. It was a crazy day but we made it and found somewhere to stay.
