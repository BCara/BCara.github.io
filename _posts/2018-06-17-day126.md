We started the day with a hike up to the three crosses. The path was full of locals doing their excercise regime. Its a fairly difficult 1 hour hike up but the locals were running or going on the gym which was at the top located just under the crosses. Looking over the town at the top was beautiful but the crosses themselves had telephone poles behind them.

Later we headed to Salento by bus from Calis bus terminal we went to Armenia and then from there we took a smaller bus to Salento. I really like Salento, it's a nice quaint little town that is surrounded by mountains.
