We travelled into Panama City from Colombia and knowing we only had one day here we tried to pack in as much as possible. For me the highlight was witnessing the ships traversing the Panama Canal. There has been some tremendous past and present engineering work on the canal and it was great to see it first hand. 

To finish the day we walked for about 2 hours
