Today we popped over to Paraguay for a day trip. After getting off at the wrong stop and struggling to find our way without internet or downloaded maps or translations we made it to Itaipu Dam. Unfortunatly, the commentary was in Spanish but that didn't matter as the Dam itself was fascinating. Truly a modern wonder of the world.
