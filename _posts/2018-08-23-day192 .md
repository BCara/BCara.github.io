I have to say, I though the Olympic National Park was going to be a huge stadium, I was quite surprised when we arrived and it was similiar to the other National Parks we had been to. It was a long drive day so we only got to stop for a short time but we managed to do about a 2 hour hike to stretch our legs. The hike we did was on top of a mountain so we had a beautiful view of the surrounding area which was covered by lovely green trees.
