Joe had quite an easy day today as he decided to have a lie in and spend the day watching the football. I ended up doing a 5 hour hike through Valle de Cocora which was absolutely amazing. It was so beautifully green and the wax palm trees towered much higher than the photos can do them justice. I think the highlight of the hike were the hummingbirds, there's a point where you can continue up or loop back to the start and you HAVE to continue. At the top you paye 5000 colombian pesos (Just over Â£1) and you get a drink but there are so many hummingbirds that are just mesmerising to watch.
