The weather picked up today so we took a bus deeper into the National Park and did a couple of small hikes. For our second walk took us through a forest and passed a small beach to reach a viewpoint for Lake Mageno which was backdropped by mountains. The highlight was the first hike of the day which was up Cerro Companario and although it was short the incline was consistently steep but the views were amazing. 360 degrees of snow topped mountains. All the surrounding mountain views from Bariloche are so beautiful but they look kind of fake as though someone has added an oil painting to the backdrop of this city.
