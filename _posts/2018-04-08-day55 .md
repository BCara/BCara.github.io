We made it on the ALMA tour!!!! I thought a tour around any astronomical observatory was not going to happen on this trip but it happened! To make sure we were top of the non-official waiting list we arrived an hour and a half early but it was 100% worth it. The tour was amazing we learned about the ALMA project and luckily got to see one of the 66 antenna which are normally situated at a location 5000 metres above sea level. Tomorrow we head into Bolivia on a three day tour to Uyuni with not WiFi. See you on the other side!
