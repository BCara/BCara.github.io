We had our first overlanding border control today, crossing from Brazil to Argentina. It took a lot longer than anticipated, the border itself didn't take long but waiting for the bus felt like an age. Multiple buses went by and wouldn't stop. Not sure why? Anyway, we finally made it to Puerto Iguazu in Argentina in time for a burger from a van.
