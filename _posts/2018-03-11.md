It's been awhile since our last update as yesterday we completed the W trek around Torres del Paine Nationsl Park. It was amazing so stay tuned for the full blog! Today we got bus to El Calafate and saw the glaciar Perito Moreno. We saw the ice calving and crashing into the riverriver, really cool.
