We needed to head to San Jose to catch a flight to Guatemala with a layover in El Salvador for a couple of nights. However, it wasn't as easy as it may sound! We bought a ticket for the 14:45 bus from La Fortuna to San Jose and arrived at the bus station at 14:30. After hanging around until 15:00 we decided to ask someone where it was... it was gone. It had literally been and gone because the bus arrived early and it was full it decided to leave. Fortunately, there was another bus at 16:10 so we turned up at 15:30 and waited and this time we got on the bus. 

The public transport system in Costa Rica hasn't been as organised, simple or intuitive as South America.
