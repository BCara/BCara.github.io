Another long drive day as we are heading down south to make it to yosemite but we managed to stop at Lake Tahoe on the way. Lake Tahoe is huge and we ended up driving around it for a bit whilst we got lost trying looking for the beach. We made it to one in the end and got some time to relax, the water was freezing so we didn't end up going in but tt was a beautiful spot to relax and view the beautful landscape.
