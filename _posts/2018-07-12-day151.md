A day of getting to know Antigua. We spent about 2 hours wandering around visiting the ruins and lookout points. Antigua is beautiful and there's so much to see in such a small place. 

We also managed to sort out a 2 day 1 night hike up the Acatenango volcano which sounds amazing but potentially very difficult. Hopefully we make it, fingers crossed.
