We walked quite a distance today. We started the day with a free walking tour around Mexico City. The first thing we noticed was how slanty most of the buildings were because they are sinking. It makes for interesting architecture, for example, rocks from volcanos have been used to lighten up the structures. We then visited the Anthropology museum which was huge, there was so much to see and well worth the trip. 

Absolutely shattered now.
