There didn't appear to be much to do in Castro so we wandered along the waters edge and visted the fish market. Then we were off again but only a short distance to Ancud which is another town in Chiloe. We had just left the hostel to try and fish from the harbour when it started heavily raining. Needless to say it wasn't long before we were heading back.
