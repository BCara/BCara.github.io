We missed diving so much we just had to have another go but this time in Belice. The dive was pretty impressive we saw soo many nurse sharks, a caribbean reef shark, a turtle and so much more. We even stopped to see if we could find a manatee on the way back we did. Yayyy! A perfect end to a couple of impressive dives. 

However, the day wasn't over yet! We had a long overnight bus into Cancun, Mexico. It was a looooong evening with quite a few stops which meant not much sleep.
