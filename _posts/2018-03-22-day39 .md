Another rainy day. We planned to do nothing today because of the weather, however, it dried up for a few hours so we went to a small beach for some fishing. It didn't take long before it really started to pour with rain and we headed back indoors. Hope the weather is a little bit better tomorrow so we can see some penguins!
