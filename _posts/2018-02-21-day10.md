Slightly disappointing day today. We went to visit the Argentinian side of the falls after witnessing such stunning views of the falls from the Brazilian side previously. However, we didn't expect it to take so long to get to them so we had to rush in and out. We managed to snap a few photos but didn't get the chance to do some treks or relax and take it in as we had our flight to catch. An upside to the day was that fortunately we were sat on the right side to see the falls from the aeroplane, amazing.
