Our second night bus in a row done and we arrived in Mancora in the early hours of the morning. Fortunately, we were able to check in and have a little rest before we head out and explored the small beach town of Mancora. In the evening we headed to the pier to do some fishing and saw numerous fishermen heading out on boats and bringing back fish but we didn't catch a thing.
