The town of Victoria Falls is a small one and is in a sort of L shape. The first thing we noticed when we hit the town was the expense. There were a number of fantastic activities but all were extremely pricey. Not only that but some of the branded food that had been fairly cheap in Namibia and Botswana was expensive here.

The next problem was cash! Zimbabwe uses US dollars as their own currency has crashed. The problem was we couldn't withdraw any dollars from the ATM as there was nothing in them. After traipsing round about 6 different ATMs it was obvious that we weren't going to get anywhere. We eventually found out that they were refilling the ATMs the next morning... yay, with bond notes... ergh. This was not what we wanted to hear. Bond notes are one to one with the dollar but are simply a piece of paper that isn't worth anything outside Zimbabwe. On the upside, everywhere accepted card and Monzo has worked everywhere we have been so far.

Victoria Falls itself was truly stunning!!  In November it is at low water which appears to be the worst time to see the falls but it meant we got to see more of the formation around the falls. Each time the sun would come out a rainbow shone which was beautiful. This has been a highlight of the trip so far.
