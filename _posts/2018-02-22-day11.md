Now in Buenos Aires we had a day to get to know the place and find out what we can do. We wandered around this amazing city where all the roads are completely straight and the buildings show different architectural styles. Towards the end of the day we joined a free walking tour which took us from the National Congress to Plaza de Mayo with the Pink house along the way we learned about the city including the fact that we had walked across the largest avenue in the world.
