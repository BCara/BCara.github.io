So today we screwed up really, our original plan was to travel from Montezuma to Monteverde for the full day. However, we thought this would be possible even if we had a lie in and got the later bus to the ferry terminal. Noone thought to check the ferry times and we just assumed we would be straight on it ready for the next bus on the other side. Unfortunately, this was not the case and we ended up staying in Puntarenas for the night. 

Puntarenas is nothing special, there's a beach with a pier but it's not a place worth spending much time.
