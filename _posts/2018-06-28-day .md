Our final day in Colombia was spent wandering around Cartagena getting to know the place. I quite liked cartagena, it is one of the prettier cities we have been to and there's quite a few things to do. It was interesting see the remains of the wall that was built to protect it from the multiple seiges the city had to endure.
