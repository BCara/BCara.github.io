Although we didn't do much in the way of sight-seeing we did a lot in the way of organising for our multi day hike around Torres Del Paine. We embark on our 5 day hike around the National Park tomorrow. It took a lot longer than I had anticipated to get food and stuff ready. We managed to rent a stove and cooking gear from somewhere so that saved some pennies. I am, however, a little concerned because it doesn't all quite fit in our bag!
