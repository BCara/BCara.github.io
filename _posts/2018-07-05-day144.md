We finally made it to Monteverde, half a day later than expected. So far Monteverde was definitely worth a vist. We arrived and it was raining so it was advised to not do the walks and save them for tomorrow but we had a wander around town and saw a few animals along the way. We saw hummingbirds, something rolling across the floor, loads of butterflies and potentially a Toucan. 

Later in the evening we did a guided night walk and managed to see a sloth!! Finally... on the amazon tour in Bolivua the other group got to see a sloth but we missed it. We also saw a tarantula which was a lot prettier than I had anticipated and massive. However, my highlight was seeing an armadillo.
