Today we travelled to Medellin (Colombia) but before we did the 7 hour windy drive from Salento we headed for a tour of a coffee plantation. We learned about the whole process of making coffee from picking the beans to how they are roasted. That pack of coffee that's advertised as rich, aromatic and dark roasted, well if it's dark roasted its covering up the bad qualities of the bean. Learn somthing new every day.
