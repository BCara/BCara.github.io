We could not get enough of gambling so decided to hit the roulette tables after breakfast but our winning streak came to an end sow e stopped whilst we were still up. 

Now for the roadtrip! We picked up our Ford Fusion (an upgrade) and headed to our first stop. There's a post box in the Galapagos where you pick up a postcard and then hand deliver them, so this was the first stop. We turned into a street and passed a huge mansion thinking the map was wrong but no we were right. Unfortunately, they weren't in so we had to leave the postcard with a note and turn around to our next destination. 

The Valley of Fire was an amazing drive and we got there during sunset. The rocks were bright red, orange and browns and with the sun beaaming down it was a beautiful landscape.
