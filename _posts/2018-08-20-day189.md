It was a long way to get to the park so we only spent a couple of hours there. The park is also having issues with fires so part of it is closed off. We headed to the 'Many Glaciars' entrance to the park and did a vey short hike around a lake, we didn't end up seeing a glaciar but we did see a couple of Grizzly bears in the distance. We also drove through a couple of other areas of the park, the mist prevented us from getting a clear view of the beautiful surroundings but it added a mystic effect.
