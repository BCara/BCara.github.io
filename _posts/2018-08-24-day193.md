This was one of my favourite days, we went to the 'Future of Flight' museum and although the musuem itself wasn't overwhelming the tour of the factory was the highlight. The tour was of the Boeing factory which is located not far from the Museum itself. We saw four bays of the manufacturing facility and the guide took us through the manufacturing process and the differences between the different types of Boeing plane. The guide was fantastic and knew a lot about the manufacturing process, plane design and just general information.

They also had an airport for at the Museum, mainly for test flights and private planes but we got to see a KC-46 come in from its test flight.
