We arrived yesterday to La Paz and it's a strange city and I can't quite put my finger on why. When we first arrived on the bus the place looked run down and dirty, closer to the centre it definitely becomes more like a city but it still feels run down in comparison to Sucre.

I am not sure I have ever been mountain biking but today we got on some bikes and cycled down death road. At first the trip started on tarmac and that was nerve racking but when we finally got off the tarmac and onto death road that's when it got scary. After awhile I started to gain confidence and it felt more comfortable going faster. I have never concentrated so much in my life to ensure I didn't hit a dodgy stone or swerve off the cliff. Unfortunately, someone in our group fell off and got a cut on his face that required stitches but all in all he was fine. Definitely an adrenaline fueled day!!
