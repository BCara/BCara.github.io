Arrived in Uyuni after 3 days travelling through the desert in a 4x4 from San Pedro. It appears to be the most common way of travelling from Chile to Bolivia so you meet loads of people along the way. We saw some geysers, drank quinoa, coca and cactus beer, saw some beautiful lakes and rock formations. However, the main event were the salt flats which go on for miles and some perspective photos can be taken.
