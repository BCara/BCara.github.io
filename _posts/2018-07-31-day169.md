In the afternoon we visited the ancient Mayan site of Tikal. It's an amazing place with multiple temples still standing tall. Visiting the ruins was amazing but we had some issues on our tour with the guide. He was slightly rude which upset a few people in our group but we also went to view the sunset which got cut short because some people had to leave.
