Today was our final day in Valparaiso and the best part was our visit to the cultural centre. There was lots going on with people just doing their own thing; playing instruments, dancing, meditating and generally just having a good time. It was such a chilled but happy atmosphere that fits well with Valparaiso's vibe. Another interesting but strange event was a bark off between sea lions and street dogs on the beach.
