We had a long drive today to get as south as possible to get closer to Yosemite. We did manage to get a mornings White Water Rafting in down Salmon River. Before we started we got wrapped up nice and warm with a wet suite, fleece and coat over the top. This probably should have been a warning that the water was going to be freezing and sure enough it was. We did levels 3 and 4 with a couple of breaks to drift along some easier spots. Halfway through there was a waterfall which we had to bypass so we had to hop out. At the other end you could rock jump back into the river to get the raft but we ended up skipping that bit. The final rapid was the highlight, it was a level 5, yes a level 5 and it was basically a mini waterfall. We practiced some special maneuvers before heading over and then we went for it and nobody fell out. It was such an adrenaline rush!
