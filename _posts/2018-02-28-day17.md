Absolutely shattered today. We went to Tierra Del Fuego in Ushuaia and it was unbelievably beautiful with the landscapes covered with mountains. We did the strenuous hike which was to the peak of Cerro Guanaco. It started off hard then softened up a bit and the end was pretty extreme but the views from the top made it worth it.
