Now in Valparaiso we did a walking tour around the city and immediately saw all the graffiti, it is everywhere you cannot miss it. Some of it is really artistic and amazing to see. The city is also built over hills so there are a few elevators that take you up steep sections which is why the city has become a world heritage sight. Completely different atmosphere to our previous destinations.
