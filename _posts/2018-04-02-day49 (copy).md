Today was close but hasn't quite beaten my favourite day climbing the volcano! Today started out pretty slow by figuring out what there is to do in La Sarena. This led us to a tranquil walk round some Japanese gardens where we saw some turtles swimming and bathing in the sun. To end the day we went to an observatory and spent the evening looking and learning about the stars through a telescope and with our naked eye. The sky was so clear, it was the perfect evening to see the stars. We saw the Milky Way, Southern Cross, Sirius, Nebulas and Star Clusters. It was AMAZING.
