We did another walking today but this time around Recoleta which is one of the richest neighbourhoods within Buenos Aires. We saw some beautiful buildings and parks and learned about the Falkland Islands from an Argentinian perspective. We also went for Ice cream as it was mentioned that you can't leave Buenos Aires without trying the Ice Cream and I have to say, it was pretty good!
