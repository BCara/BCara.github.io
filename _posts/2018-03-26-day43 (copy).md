Literally, my favourite day so far! We climbed the active Volcano Villarica in Pucon. It started off similar to a normal hike but on volcanic rock but swiftly changed to snow and then glacier. It was the first time we had used kit like an ice pick and crampons to support us. The journey up was new and difficult but such an adrenaline rush and the views were amazing. We got closer to the top and we knew because you could literally taste the sulpher. The crater at the top was such a cool site, you couldn't see any lava but the crater rocks were colourful and there was smoke coming from it. The way down was also something different, it took a lot less time to get down because we sledged most of the way. So Cool!
