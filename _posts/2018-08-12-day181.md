Again, we chilled during the day. Then myself and Joe went to see Cirque de Soleil - Mystere and I have to say I was extremely underwhelmed. There was a lot more filler bits than was necessary which ruined the acrobatics and it just wasn't as clean as I would have expected. On the other hand there were pockets of exceptional sections. Later we had a crack at the gambling and we actually ended up doing well at Roulette.

The strip, of course, was buzzing with the Bellagio fountain being one of the highlights. A good way to end our final evening in Vegas.
