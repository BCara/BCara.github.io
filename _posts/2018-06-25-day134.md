One of main attractions in Santa Marta is Parque Tayrona so we headed there for a short hike but mainly for the beaches. Yes, they make you work to get to the beaches but they are gorgeous. It was nice just to relax and hang out. We decided not to do the hike back and get the bus but to get a boat back, it was unbelievably choppy. 

We had spent the whole of Colombia with a group of cool people but tonight was our last night before we headed our separate ways so we had a very nice (but expensive) meal together and a few drinks round the pool. The perfect farewell.
