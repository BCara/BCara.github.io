A 5 hour travel day turned into a ten hour travel day and a direct bus turned into two buses. By now we should have expected that.

We got to Rio Dulce and it started really pouring down with rain and I mean pouring. It was like someone just turned on the tap to Rio Dulce. We hung out under sone shelter and then headed to our hostel. Our hostel, Dreamcatcher, is lovely, it's based in the middle of the water and is so serene.
