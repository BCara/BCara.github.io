Today was a football day! It happened to be the league cup final so we managed to find a bar (eventually...) that showed the English football. Fortunately we set off early and got there 5 minutes after the start (not sure I could have coped with the wrath of Joe if this hadn't have happened). On Sundays there is a huge market in San Telmo so on our way back we walked through this and the items on sale were really artistic and intersting, I wish I had the money and space to bring back some trinkets. Later in the evening it was football again but this time we sat with the locals and got to experience an argentinian football match.
