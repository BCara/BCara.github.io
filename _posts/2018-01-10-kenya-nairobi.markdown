Our last and final stop within Africa was Nairobi in Kenya. As we headed to Nairobi the traffic was unbelievable, I have never seen anything like it. It was a complete stand still with cars and lorries forcing themselves through impossible gaps and some very strange maneuvers. There was a point where our truck went down a small but steep drop into the middle and I have to admit I was slightly scared of the truck tipping over. According to our guide the amount of traffic around Nairobi was not normal so I'm not sure what was going on.


We arrived at the Wildebeest Eco Camp which was our last stop on our trip. Most of our tour group were staying there for the night before either continuing on with an additional 14 days tour or heading back to their homes. Unfortunately, we had booked to stay somewhere else which was a shame as this campsite was really nice. It had a pool, table tennis and a great bar which we made the most of. We ended up staying at the bar until quite late so we could say our goodbyes to everyone. I have to say traveling with the Africa Travel Company (ATC) was an amazing experience! We saw so many beautiful landscapes, interesting culture and most importantly made some fantastic friends!


We had booked to stay in Kenya for a couple of days after the tour had ended so we could spend some time in Nairobi and this was definitely worthwhile. One of my favourite things we did on this trip was visiting David Sheldricks Elephant Orphanage. During the day they open their doors between 11:00 and 12:00 so you can see the baby elephant orphans. They are so cute when they run in and you get to see them drinking from their bottles and learn about their sad pasts. Most of the elephants have either lost their mothers to poachers or droughts and they are unable to survive for a few years without their mother so they need to be looked after.


We also ended up adopting Enkesha who is a little baby elephant that lost her mum to poachers. Enkesha also ended up in the poachers snare and her trunk was seriously severed. She had to have an emergency operation in an attempt to fix the huge gouge in her trunk, the operation was successful but she was so strong that she actually ripped out the stitches. However, she is doing amazing. There are still issues with her trunk but she has learned to put her trunk deep into the water buckets to allow her to drink. A smart Nellie!!


You can adopt an elephant for just $50! You decide which elephant to follow and find out more information but ultimately the money goes to them all so there are no hard feelings between elephants! It's an amazing cause that is 100% worth doing. Also, if you end up adopting an elephant you can book an appointment to see them go to bed. This was one of my best experiences yet and an unmissable if you are in Nairobi! We got to see Enkesha getting settled in and warm under blanket.


The other thing you can't miss in Nairobi is the Giraffe Centre. We got to not only learn and stroke a giraffe but also kiss one! Yeah that was a bit sloppy and strange but cool all the same. It's also for a good cause to protect the endangered Rothschild giraffes!


All in all this was a brilliant end to the trip, considering it had to end at all!
