The Hoover Dam is an amazing piece of engineering. The construction of the Dam itself solved many problems but during its build many innovative solutions were found to ensure it stuck to time limits and specification. A simple drive over the dam shows how large and spectacular the construction is. 

The afternoon was spent driving onwards and through Sedona. The drive into Sedona was beautiful, you could see the huge red rocks as we descended down a cliff edge. However, on the way back to Flagstaff we decided to take the main route 179 but the weather ended up being terrible with heavy rain so the views were not quite as spectacular.
