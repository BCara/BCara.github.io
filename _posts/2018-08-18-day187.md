We were still recovering from the hike the day before so we decided to do the South side of Yellowstone by car with a few pitstops. The park is full of geysers, on our first stop it was raining and grey but the pools were still colourful. On our second stop we saw a geyser erupt, that was pretty cool. 

In the afternoon we decided to do something educational and headed to a talk on a featured animal, in our case we learned about cats including mountain lion, lynx and the bobcat. 

Just driving around Yellowstone is amazing. There are so many places to stop and see beautiful landscapes. After we exited the park we saw a bear on a hill top just laying around.
