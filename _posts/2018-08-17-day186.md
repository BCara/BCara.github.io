Grand Teton National Park is beautiful with so many hiking options. We chose an 8 mile (ish) hike around Phelps lake, it was gorgeous. A little difficult on the way back as it was uphill in the sun but defintely worth it. The lake was pristine and there was an area for some rock jumping so we got the adrenaline going and threw ourselves off into the very cold lake. 

On the way back we saw a bear. Yes, an actual bear!! Soo crazy. We actually didn't notice it until we were about 10 metres away. Amazing.
