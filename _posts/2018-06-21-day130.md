Onwards to Guatape and on arrival we went to Pablo Escobars mansion on the river. Pablo Escobar was a drug lord in Colombia. His mansion is completely worn down with loads of holes all over the buildings where they searched for his money. It was interesting to see and hear from one of his ex employees.
