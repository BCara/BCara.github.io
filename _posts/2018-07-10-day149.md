Our second hike up to the top of a Volcano. I would definitely recommend this hike, it wasn't too difficult and the views at the top were amazing. Throughout the hike you have views both Cerro Verde and Volcano Izalco but at the top you can see a small steaming lake in the centre of the Santa Ana Volcano.
