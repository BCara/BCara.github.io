Today is our final day in Namibia as we head towards the border crossing and then into Botswana.

Namibia is an interesting country and the past 10 days have been jam packed.

There have been many highlights from this stretch of the trip. For me, both the Sesriem and Fish River Canyons were an amazing natural site. Watching the Elephants as they went about their usual activities. However, the most memorable part was meeting the Himba tribe. This was an eye opening and grounding experience, the children were all running around and extremely lively and friendly. Oh, and the skydiving was pretty amazing as well!
I know one of Joe's favourite activities were the nightwalks where we walked around our campsite looking under rocks and keeping our eyes peeled for all types of creatures including scorpions and spiders.

Next stop is the crossing at the Mamuno border and then into Botswana for many more fun filled activities.
