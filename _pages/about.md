Cara and Joe take on the World... Not quite. They have just come back from a two month tour around southern/eastern africa. 
The trip started with a quick stopover in Dubai and then straight on to Cape Town to begin the African adventure. The African trip was guided by Africa Travel Company and included multiple game drives, cultural experiences and scenic excursions. 

42 days, 10,310km travelled and 7 countries visted:

Namibia,
Botswana,
Zimbabwe,
Zambia,
Tanzania
and finally Kenya.

The next stage in their adventures will take them to South America early 2018. Stay tuned to find out more!
