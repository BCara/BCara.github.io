Cara and Joe take on the World... Not quite, let's start with southern Africa on a two month tour. 
The trip starts with a quick stopover in Dubai and then straight into Cape Town where the plan is to cage dive with Sharks. After Cape Town the journey takes us through a number of countries including:

Namibia,
Botswana,
Zimbabwe,
Zambia,
Tanzania
and finally Kenya.

The trip is guided by Africa Travel Company and will include a trip to the Orange River, Victoria Falls, the Serengeti (hopefully) and more.
