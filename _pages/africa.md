Our trip round Africa took us to various destinations within many countries and countless experiences. We have tried to summarise the important points for travelling between the various countries that we learned along the way. 

## South Africa
**Currency:** South African Rand. US dollars may also be accepted for some tourist activities. 
**Payment:** Card was accepted at all restaurants, bars and shops. Activities occassionally required cash payment. 
**Visas:** For a UK citizen there are no visa requirements for up to 90 days.
**Travel:** We were advised to not walk around after dark. Uber is available in Cape Town and is the cheapest, safest and most convenient way to travel both after dark and during the day. 
**Internet:** Cape Town has a number of WiFi spots in restaurants, bars and at the shopping centre. 

## Namibia
**Currency:** Namibian Dollars. Namibian dollars are 1 to 1 with south african rand and it is possible to use south african rand in Namibia. US dollars may also be accepted at campsites and tourist places.
**Payment:** Card was accepted at all restaurants, bars and shops. Activities occassionally required cash payment. 
**Visas:** For a UK citizen there are no visa requirements for up to 90 days.
**Travel:** On our vist we travelled on a truck as part of a tour but there were a number of 4x4 veihicles with tents on the roof. A 4x4 appears to be the best way of travelling if part of a small group or couple. 
**Internet:** Every camp site we visted had a wifi spot. 

## Botswana 
**Currency:** Botswana pula. US dollars may also be accepted at campsites and tourist places.
**Payment:** Card was accepted at all restaurants, bars and shops. Activities occassionally required cash payment. 
**Visas:** For a UK citizen there are no visa requirements for up to 90 days.
**Travel:** Again, we travelled on a truck but many visitors were travelling by 4x4 with tents on the roof. 
**Internet:** Every camp site we visted had a wifi spot. 

## Zimbabwe
Victoria Falls town.
**Currency:** US Dollars. This was an interesting part of the trip as Zimbabwes currency is US Dollars. However, when we tried to withdraw cash from the ATMs they were all empty due to be restocked with... bond notes which are obviously only valid in Zimbabwe. If you are travelling to Zimbabwe make sure you have enough currency or a travel fee free card. 
**Payment:** Thankfully, Card was accepted everywhere!
**Visas:** For a UK citizen a visa costs 55 US dollars. There is an option for KAZA visa which allows entry into both Zimbabwe and Zambia and also allows day trips into Botswana (This does not include overnight stay). The KAZA visa is 50 dollars so it ends up cheaper than a single visa into Zimbabwe. **BUT** when we arrived, although it was advertised, they didn't have any forms left and therefore it was not possible to obtain a KAZA visa. 
**Internet:** The camp site we stayed at had free decent wifi.

## Zambia
**Currency:** Zambian kwacha. 
**Payment:** Card was accepted in most places. 
**Visas:** For a UK citizen a visa costs 50 US dollars. As mentioned for Zimbabwe, there is an option for the KAZA visa. As we had already been to Zimbabwe and were unable to obtain the KAZA visa there we didn't try for this visa. However, we would have run into the same problems and not been able to get one. 
**Internet:** Most campsites we stayed at had free Wifi but only for limited megabytes. 

## Malawi
**Currency:** Malawian kwacha. Although most tourist trips accepted dollars.  
**Payment:** Card was accepted in campsite bars but cash may be required for certain tourist trips.  
**Visas:** For a UK citizen a visa costs 75 US dollars.
**Internet:** Some campsites had free Wifi but there was a limit on megabytes. Other places did not have wifi.  

## Tanzania
**Currency:** Tanzanian Shillings.  
**Payment:** Card was accepted in campsite bars.  
**Visas:** For a UK citizen a visa costs 50 US dollars.
**Internet:** Some camp sites had free wifi, other camp sites had paid wifi and others did not have wifi at all.
