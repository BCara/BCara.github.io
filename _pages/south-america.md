- Rio
- Foz de Iguazu 

**Currency:** Brazilian Real  
**Payment:** Card was accepted at most restaurants, bars and shops. All tourist activities were payable by card. Some websites noted that there may be issues with card cloning but we had no prolems.   
Monzo card worked fine.  
**ATMS:** The airports charged roughly Â£5 for withdrawals.  
**Visas:** For a UK citizen there were no visa requirements for a tourist for up to 90 days.  
**Internet & Phone:** It's worth checking with the specific Hostel/Hotel. We had no problems accept occassional drop outs at our hotel.  
We used a three phone with a Feel At Home Advanced package and we had no issues. At some points the internet connectivity was slow but there were no major problems.  

### Rio
**ATMS:** On our arrival in Rio (Tuesday 13th February) we struggled to get cash as banks were closed and boarded for Carnaval. The next day they were open but each Santander branch and a couple of other branch types wouldn't allow us to withdraw any money. Banco do Brazil finally worked.  
**Travel:** Ubers in Rio were readily available as well as buses for R$3.60 a ride. A metro is also available but we never tried it. There is also a good walking route that is easy to follow. Google maps showed information for public transport.  
**Internet:** It's worth checking with the specific Hostel/Hotel. A few bars had wifi.
