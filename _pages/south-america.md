## Brazil
12 February to 20th February

**Currency:** Brazilian Real
**Payment:** Card was accepted at most restaurants, bars and shops. All tourist activities we did was payable by card. Some websites noted that there may be issues with card cloning but we had no prolems. 
Monzo card works fine.
**ATMS:** The airport charged roughly Â£5 for withdrawals. On our arrival in Rio (Tuesday 13th February) we struggled to get cash as banks were closed and boarded for Carnaval. The next day they were open but each Santander branch and a couple of other branch types wouldn't allow us to withdraw any money. Banco do Brazil finally worked. 
**Visas:** For a UK citizen there were no visa requirements for a tourist for up to 90 days.
**Travel:** Ubers are readily available as well as buses for R$3.60 a ride. A metro is also available but we never tried it. There is also a good walking route that is easy to follow.  
**Internet:** It's worth checking with the specific Hostel/Hotel. We had no problems accept occassional drop outs at our hotel.
